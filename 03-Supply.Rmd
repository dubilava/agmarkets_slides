# Firms maximize profit

.pull-left[
![](art/supply.png)
]

.pull-right[
- Much like consumers are utility-maximizers, firms are profit-maximizers. 
- For a firm producing a product, $q$, using a set of inputs, $\mathbf{z}=(z_1,\ldots,z_k)'$ , the short-run profit is defined as: $$\pi = pq-w'z,$$ where $p$ is a unit price of $q$, and $\mathbf{w}=(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$ is a vector of input costs.
]

# Production function

.right-column[
- A firm's output is related to inputs via a production function: $$q = q(\mathbf{z})$$
- We can, thus, rewrite he profit function as: $$\pi = pq(\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{w}'\mathbf{z}.$$ 
- We can use this equation to derive a producer's supply function of output and demand functions for inputs. 
<!-- The relevant supply function depends on the form of the production function, hence the form of the cost functions. -->

# Marginal product of input

.right-column[
- A producer maximizes profits by using each input up to the point where the last unit just pays for itself. 
- Optimal use of inputs is determined with respect to the (known) production function. 
- The functional form of production is such that output is increasing with input, but at a decreasing rate. 
- The rate at which output increases is referred to as the *marginal product* of input: $$MP_i=\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i}$$
]

---


# The optimal amount of input

.right-column[
- The optimum level of factor use is at the point where the $MP_i$ multiplied by price of output, $p$, just equals to the unit cost of input, $w_i$, which yields the following relationship:$$\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i} = \frac{w_i}{p}$$
- This relationship implies that an increase of the input cost, will lead to reduced use of that input and lower output, *ceteris paribus*. 
- Moreover, optimal factor use will change only with an increase or decrease in relative prices.

# Firm's costs and supply

.pull-left[
A firm's costs, $C(q)$, consist of fixed costs, $F$, that don't change in the short run, and variable costs, $V(q)$, that change with output.

Average costs: $\frac{C(q)}{q}=\frac{F}{q}+\frac{V(q)}{q}$

Marginal cost: $MC=\frac{\partial C(q)}{\partial q}$

# Economies of scale

.right-column[
- *Economies of scale* happen when average total cost decreases as output increases, i.e. when the marginal cost curve is below the average total cost curve.
- *Diseconomies of scale* happen when average total cost increases as output increases, i.e. when marginal cost is above the average total cost curve.
]

---


# A measure of economies of scale

.right-column[
- A measure of economies of scale, $s$, is the average total cost to marginal cost ratio, which is equivalent to the total cost elasticity of output: $$s=\frac{AC(q)}{MC(q)} \equiv \frac{\partial q}{\partial C(q)} \frac{C(q)}{q}$$
- We have increasing returns to scale (i.e., economies of scale) when $s>1$, decreasing returns to scale (i.e., diseconomies of scale) when $s<1$, and constant returns to scale when $s=1$.
]

---


# Market supply

.right-column[
- Market supply is a (horizontal) sum of firm's supply curves. 
- Assuming $n$ identical firms, each producing $q$ units of optimal output, the aggregate market supply is $Q = nq$. The supply curve, generally, is upward sloping, which is inferred in the *law of supply*. 
]

# The supply mover and shifters

.right-column[
- Own price of a good is a sole factor affecting the quantity supplied resulting in the movement along the supply curve. 
- All other factors *shift the supply curve*. Such factors can be: 
  * prices of inputs; 
  * prices of related goods (e.g., palm oil and soybean oil); 
  * goods competing for the same factors of production (e.g., the land used to produce corn and soybeans); 
  * joint production of goods (e.g., soybean meal and soybean oil); 
  * factors affecting production costs and output quantities; 
  * production risks (e.g., weather-related); 
  * taxes and subsidies.

# Supply elasticity

.right-column[
- The responsiveness of the supply to price changes is known as *price elasticity of supply* (supply elasticity). 
- Mathematically, supply elasticity is given by: $$\eta = \frac{\partial Q}{Q}/\frac{\partial P}{P} \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q}$$
]

---


# Supply elasticity

.right-column[
- Supply elasticities can be categorized as:
  * Perfectly inelastic (vertical line): the elasticity measure of zero. 
  * Inelastic: the elasticity measures between $0$ and $1$. 
  * Elastic: the elasticity measures greater than $1$. 
  * Perfectly elastic (horizontal line): the elasticity measure of $\infty$.
- In the very short run, agricultural supply elasticity is nearly zero; as the time-frame increases, producers are able to react to price changes and, thus, the supply elasticity increases.
]

# Supply elasticity

.right-column[
- Assuming a linear supply curve, as quantity and price increase (i.e., as we move upwards along the supply curve) the price elasticity of supply converges to $1$. 
- Moreover, if a linear supply curve intersects with the origin, the elasticity of supply is always $1$.
