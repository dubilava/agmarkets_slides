# Supply by a Single Firm

Much like consumers are utility--maximizers, the firms are profit--maximizers. For a firm producing a product, `\(q\)`, using a set of inputs, `\(z=(z_1,\ldots,z_k)'\)` , the short-run profit is defined as: `$$\pi = pq-w'z,$$` where `\(p\)` is a unit price of `\(q\)`, and `\(w=(w_1,\ldots,w_k)\)` is a vector imput costs.

---


# Supply by a Single Firm

A firm's output is related to the inputs through a production function: `$$q = q(z)$$`

The profit function, thus, can be rewritten as: `$$\pi = pq(z)-w'z.$$` This equation can be used in deriving the producer's supply function of output and demand functions for inputs. 
&lt;!-- The relevant supply function depends on the form of the production function, hence the form of the cost functions. --&gt;

# Supply by a Single Firm

A producer maximizes profits by using each factor up to the point where the last unit just pays for itself. Optimal use of input is determined with respect to the (known) production function. The functional form of production is such that output is increasing with input, but at a decreasing rate. The rate of increase in output is called the *marginal (physical) product* of input: `$$MP_i=\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i}$$`

---


# Supply by a Single Firm

Following the rule of profit maximization, the optimum level of factor use is at the point where the `\(MP_i\)` multiplied by price of output, `\(p\)`, just equals to the unit cost of input, `\(w_i\)`, which yields the following relationship:$$\frac{\partial q}{\partial z_i} = \frac{w_i}{p}$$

This relationship implies that an increase of the input cost, will lead to reduced use of that input and lower output, everything else held constant. Moreover, optimal factor use will change only with an increase or decrease in relative prices.

---


# Market Supply

Market supply is a (horizontal) aggregate of individual firm's supply curves. Assuming `\(n\)` identical firms, each producing `\(q\)` units of optimal output, the aggregate market supply is `\(Q = nq\)`. The supply curve, generally, is upward sloping, which is inferred in the *law of supply*. 

---


# Market Supply

Own price of a good is a sole factor affecting the quantity supplied resulting in the movement along the supply curve. 

All other factors *shift the supply curve*. Such factors can be: 

- prices of inputs; 
- prices of related goods; 
- goods competing for the same factors of production (e.g., the same land for corn and soybeans); 
- joint production of goods (e.g., soybean meal and soybean oil); 
- factors affecting production costs and output quantities (e.g., technology and weather); 
- production risks; 
- taxes and subsidies, etc.

# Supply Elasticity

The responsiveness of the supply to price changes is known as *price elasticity of supply* (supply elasticity). Mathematically, supply elasticity is given by: `$$\eta = \frac{\partial Q}{Q}/\frac{\partial P}{P} \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}\frac{P}{Q}$$`

---


# Supply Elasticity

In the very short run, supply is perfectly inelastic (vertical line) and the elasticity is zero. Inelastic supply refers to elasticity measures between `\(0\)` and `\(1\)`. Elastic supply refers to elasticity measures greater than `\(1\)`. A perfectly elastic supply (horizontal line) has the elasticity measure or `\(\infty\)`.

Assuming a linear supply curve, as quantity and price increase (i.e., as we move upwards along the supply curve) the price elasticity of supply converges to `\(1\)`. Moreover, if a linear supply curve intersects with the origin, the elasticity of supply is always `\(1\)`.

# Market Structure

To begin, we assume that there are many sellers and buyers in a market, and that each individual seller or buyer cannot influence the market. Furthermore, we assume that the product is homogenous, that there are no costs associated with entering and leaving the market, and that the information on economic forces that are determining prices is complete and freely available for market participants. Such market is referred to as a perfectly competitive market. 

A perfectly competitive market is efficient, in that the market equilibrium leads to the socially optimal outcome. Such markets only exist in theory, however, as one or several assumptions of a perfectly competitive market are usually violated. 

---


# Market Structure

On the other end of the spectrum, we have a monopoly (or a monopsony). In the case of a monopoly, we have a single seller (in the case of a monopsony we have a single buyer). The product homogeneity assumption is automatically met. However, there are very high costs associated with entering the market.

A monopolist, unlike a competitive firm, is no longer a price-taker; instead, they can 'manipulate' quantity demanded by changing prices, or (equivalently) they can manipulate market prices by changing their output. 

Market equilibrium under monopoly leads to an inefficient outcome, as some of the surplus - which would have been attained under a perfectly competitive market - is lost; this is known as the *dead-weight loss*.



---


# Market Structure

In-between of a perfectly competitive market and a monopoly (or a monopsony) we have oligopoly (or oligopsony), which means several sellers (or buyers) on the market. 

If these sellers collude, the market outcome under oligopoly can be identical to that under monopoly. 

Even if they do not collude, but act strategically, they can still extract additional surplus from consumers, also leading to an inefficient outcome and the dead-weight loss (albeit not as large as that under monopoly). 

In some instances - e.g., if oligopolists engage in a 'price war' - the resulted market equilibrium can be similar to that under a perfectly competitive market.
